# Review rubric: style

Use this rubric when reviewing code. Focus on concrete, evidence-backed findings in this lens. If multiple review rubrics are active, stay primarily within this lens and avoid duplicating the same finding under multiple labels unless it materially changes risk or severity.

Review the code for style and convention fit: whether it matches the repository's established patterns, communicates intent clearly, and stays readable without distracting inconsistency. Focus on readability, consistency, and operator-facing communication, not architectural redesign.

**Look for:**
- Naming that violates language, framework, or repo conventions
- Formatting or import organization inconsistencies
- Inconsistent patterns across similar modules, APIs, or call sites
- Comments that are missing where context is needed, outdated, redundant, or misleading
- Documentation gaps for public APIs, CLI flags, config, or user-visible behavior
- Error, log, and status messages that are unclear, noisy, or inconsistent in tone or level
- Test naming or organization that makes intent hard to understand
- Lint/format violations or local style drift from the rest of the codebase
- Public interfaces that force readers to infer basic usage from implementation details

**In a charm, also check for:**
- Config keys using names or casing that do not follow Juju conventions
- Status messages that are unclear to operators; they should be concise, specific, and actionable
- Inconsistent naming between metadata.yaml or charmcraft.yaml identifiers and Python references
- Relation, container, storage, and action names that drift between YAML, code, and tests
- Operator-facing log and status text that lacks enough context to troubleshoot safely

**Questions to answer:**
- What repo or framework conventions should this code be following?
- Where does inconsistency make the code harder to read, use, or maintain?
- Are public and operator-facing messages clear, consistent, and appropriately documented?
- What style drift is likely to spread if left uncorrected?
