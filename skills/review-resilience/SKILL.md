# Review rubric: resilience

Use this rubric when reviewing code. Focus on concrete, evidence-backed findings in this lens. If multiple review rubrics are active, stay primarily within this lens and avoid duplicating the same finding under multiple labels unless it materially changes risk or severity.

Review the code for resilience and failure handling: whether it fails safely, surfaces actionable errors, and can recover cleanly from transient, partial, and repeated failures. Focus on degraded and recovery behavior, not general business-logic correctness unless it affects failure handling.

**Look for:**
- Swallowed errors, empty catch blocks, or failure paths that silently continue
- Missing error propagation or loss of useful context
- Error messages that are vague, misleading, or not actionable
- Missing timeout, cancellation, or deadline handling
- Insufficient retry, backoff, jitter, or retry-budget logic
- Retries that are unsafe because operations are not idempotent
- Resource leaks or missing cleanup on failure (files, locks, connections, temp state)
- Partial failure states or incomplete rollback/compensation
- Startup, shutdown, or restart paths that leave the system inconsistent
- Missing circuit breakers, rate limiting, or backpressure for external dependencies
- Unhelpful panic/crash behavior or over-broad failure domains
- Recovery path gaps after dependency outages, malformed input, or corrupted state
- Logging and metrics gaps that make failures hard to diagnose

**In a charm, also check for:**
- Hooks that raise unhandled exceptions instead of setting actionable BlockedStatus or WaitingStatus
- Missing guards for not-yet-ready relations, containers, storage, or leadership state
- Deferred, replayed, or retried hooks that repeat side effects or leave inconsistent state
- Partial configuration of workload state that leaves Pebble, config files, or relation data inconsistent
- Status messages that hide failure details or fail to reflect degraded state
- Missing recovery behavior when a relation disappears, a workload container restarts, or an external service becomes reachable again

**Questions to answer:**
- What happens when dependencies are slow, unavailable, or return bad data?
- Which failures leave partial state, ambiguous status, or operator confusion?
- Are retries, timeouts, and recovery paths safe, bounded, and observable?
- If this fails in production, will operators have enough signal to diagnose and fix it?
