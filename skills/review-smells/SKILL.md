# Review rubric: code smells

Use this rubric when reviewing code. Focus on concrete, evidence-backed findings in this lens. If multiple review rubrics are active, stay primarily within this lens and avoid duplicating the same finding under multiple labels unless it materially changes risk or severity.

Review the code for code smells and change friction: patterns that make the next modification riskier, harder, or more expensive than it should be. Focus on maintainability hazards and refactoring signals, not style-only issues.

**Look for:**
- Long methods, large classes, or oversized modules accumulating multiple responsibilities
- Deep nesting or hard-to-follow control flow
- Repeated conditionals or parallel logic that should have one source of truth
- Shotgun surgery: one change requiring edits in many places
- Feature envy or logic living far from the data it manipulates
- Data clumps, long parameter lists, or primitive obsession
- Boolean flags or mode parameters that create multiple code paths in one API
- Temporary fields, speculative generality, or abstractions with no real caller need
- God objects or god functions
- Copy-paste duplication or near-duplicate logic
- TODO or FIXME comments that hide unresolved design debt
- Temporal coupling or order-sensitive APIs that are easy to misuse

**In a charm, also check for:**
- God charm classes that handle every relation, action, config, and workload concern directly
- Duplicated reconcile, configure, or status logic across multiple event handlers
- Framework event code mixed tightly with business or workload logic
- Hardcoded relation names, config keys, container names, or service constants scattered across files
- New behavior requiring edits in many handlers instead of one shared path

**Questions to answer:**
- What will make the next change risky or repetitive?
- Which abstractions or APIs are accumulating too many responsibilities?
- Where do duplication or temporal coupling suggest the wrong shape of code?
- What small refactor would buy the largest reduction in future change cost?
